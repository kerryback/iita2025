Derek Waldron, , Chief Analytics Officer:
\begin{itemize}
\item (What we're working towards is that) every employee will have their own personalized AI assistant; every process is powered by AI agents, and every client experience has an AI concierge.
\item You'll still have people at the top who are managing and have relationships with clients, but many, many of the processes underneath are now being done by AI systems.
\end{itemize}


Workers would shift from being creators of reports ... or "makers" ... to "checkers" or managers of AI agents doing that work.

\begin{itemize}
\item As AI models begin to handle underwriting, compliance, and asset allocation, the traditional architecture of financial work is undergoing a fundamental shift.
\item As job descriptions evolve, so does the definition of financial talent. Excel is no longer a differentiator. Python is fast becoming the new Excel. 
\item But technical skills alone will not cut it. The most in demand profiles today are those that speak both AI and finance.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Julius Demo Prompt 1}
   \begin{quote}
   Use the latest version of yfinance to get closing prices at a monthly frequency from Yahoo Finance for SPY, IEF, and GLD since 1970. Compute returns as percent changes and filter to the longest history for which returns for all three ETFs are available. Compute the historical mean and covariance matrix. Compute the tangency portfolio assuming the monthly risk-free rate is 0.04/12.

   \end{quote}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Julius Demo Prompt 2}
   \begin{quote}
   Compute the mean-variance frontier of risky assets using the SPY, IEF, and GLD means and covariance matrix.  Create a Word doc containing a plot of (i) the mean-variance frontier of risky assets, (ii) the risk-free rate, (iii) the tangency portfolio, and (iv) the capital allocation line, assuming again a risk-free rate of 0.04/12.  Include in the Word doc the historical means, standard deviations, and correlations of the monthly SPY, IEF, and GLD returns, an explanation of the method used to compute the tangency portfolio and your interpretation of why the tangency portfolio is what it is.  Format the Word doc professionally.
