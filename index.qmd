## Plan 

1. Example of what AI can do today - new Claude skill from September
2. Historical analogues?
3. A course on AI
4. Updating existing courses to use AI
5. Deep dive into Claude Code

## 1. Example (prompt for Claude)

::: {.quote-box}
Read the uploaded case (Valuing Walmart 2010).  Ignore the valuation method described in the case.  Instead, generate pro forma statements and perform a two-stage DCF analysis.
:::
::: {.quote-box}
Document your assumptions and your reasons for them.  Generate an Excel workbook and a Word doc. Format the Excel worksheets nicely.
:::

::: {style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 30px;"}
*Currently requires Claude Max subscription.*
:::

## 2. Historical analogues

1. Handheld calculators
2. Personal computers

::: {.quote-box}
How did teaching and learning change? Are there lessons for today?
:::

## Introduction of Handheld Calculators

- Much worry that students wouldn't learn addition, subtraction, ... 
   - Studies haven't found an effect 
   - But primary schools still provide practice and assessments in which calculators are not allowed
- Some hoped that schools could move beyond calculation and teach deeper math 
  - That didn't seem to happen either

## Introduction of Personal computers & spreadsheets

1. We added courses on how to use spreadsheets 
2. We updated existing courses to use spreadsheets
3. We assess how well students can use spreadsheets (no pencil and paper valuation analyses)

::: {.fragment}
>Teaching how to do finance in spreadsheets is a main goal.
:::

## Why?

- Spreadsheets are used in business
- Spreadsheets are ideal for teaching the logic of some things (valuation/capital budgeting)
- Spreadsheets don't automatically do the things we were teaching before (financial calculators $\rightarrow$ spreadsheets)

## What about AI?

✓ AI is used in business

✓ AI is useful for teaching/tutoring

✗ AI can automatically do many things we were teaching before

::: {.fragment}
::: {.quote-box}
AI is more like calculators than spreadsheets.  We worry that students won't learn skills that they need.  

Like primary schools and arithmetic, we will need to have practice and assessments in which AI is not allowed
:::
:::

## AI is used in Business

MIT/Media Labs State of AI in Business 2025:

::: {.quote-box}
Workers from over 90% of the companies we surveyed reported regular use of
personal AI tools for work tasks. In fact, almost every single person used an LLM in some form for their work.
:::
 
## Plan 

✓ Example of what AI can do today

✓ Historical analogues

::: {.quote-box}
3. A course on AI

4. Updating existing courses to use AI

5. Deep dive into Claude Code
:::

## 3. Course on AI: principles


- <span class="highlight">Treat AI as a colleague:</span> Collaborate, evaluate, iterate
- <span class="highlight">Vibe code financial analyses: LLMs are not trustworthy for arithmetic:</span> Coding (Python) is essential
- <span class="highlight">Create apps:</span> For critical operations, test code and save as app
- <span class="hightlight">Create custom chatbots:<\span> Chatbots can be customized through the system prompt, RAG, or fine tuning
- <span class="highlight">Create tools:</span> To use chatbot for critical operations, create app and provide as tool

## Prompt Engineering

- Some students ask for instruction on how to prompt AI
- Special techniques aren't needed.  Practice is.

Ethan Mollick, Wharton, "Good Enough Prompting:"

::: {.quote-box}
Treat AI like an infinitely patient new coworker ... As it is a coworker, you want to work with it, not just give it orders, and you also want to learn what it is good or bad at ... Working with AI is a dialogue, not an order.
:::

## Course structure 

A. Introduction

B. Coding with AI 

C. Apps, Chatbots, and Agents

## A. Course Introduction

- Example of working with AI on valuation: Claude/Excel example
- Case on corporate implementation of AI 

## Example of working with AI 

::: {.quote-box}
Claude/Excel example
:::

- Explain the calculations 
- What did you assume for ... and why?
- How does the value change if we assume ... instead?



## Case on corporate implementation

[Blazing New Trails: Responsible Generative AI and the Creative Adoption of a Large Language Model at Deloitte Canada](https://store.hbr.org/product/blazing-new-trails-responsible-generative-ai-and-the-creative-adoption-of-a-large-language-model-at-deloitte-canada/HEC382?srsltid=AfmBOoo8whYuCV6aPeMolvqA2FNyJJz0-l8D3oFSoKKObmqppQ_Y_QcO), 2024.

- Describes creation of a custom chatbot
- Discusses reliability, bias, compliance, data privacy, trust of customers

## B. Coding with AI

In March 2025, Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan and managing partner Jared Friedman stated that 

:::: {.columns style="display: flex; align-items: center;"}

## Vibe coding for finance

- Chatbots with python can easily do many types of financial analyses: regression, mean-variance optimization, binomial-tree option valuation ...
- Running python in the cloud:
  - ChatGPT, Claude, Google Colab with Gemini, Julius.ai
- Running python locally:
  - VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code 

## C. Apps, Chatbots, and Agents

:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
- Apps can use AI
- Chatbots are apps
- Agents are chatbots with tools
:::
:::
::::

## Building apps, chatbots, and agents 

- Point and click to build Custom GPTs at chat.openai.com 
- Vibe code 

## chatbot is an app consisting of

- User interface
- API connection to an LLM, which has possibly been fine-tuned
- System prompt
- Possible retrieval of documents
- Possible use of tools

## System prompt is fundamental

::: {.quote-box}
A system prompt is text that is sent to the LLM along with each user prompt. 

It contains information and instructions for the LLM.
:::

[Anthropic's System Prompts](https://docs.claude.com/en/release-notes/system-prompts#august-5-2025)

## RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) chatbots 

- Send stored chunks of documents to LLM along with prompt and system prompt
- Choose chunks most relevant to the prompt
  - Vector embedding (vector store)
  - Similarity search
- Key element of many corporate AI implementations

## Chatbot structure

![](images/chatbot.png){style="max-height: 500px; width: auto;"}



## Agent = Chatbot + Tools

- AI agent is a chatbot equipped with tools to do things
- Claude and ChatGPT are agents - they can send code to Python environments
- Database tools are very useful for chatbots

## Claude for Financial Services

From [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-for-financial-services):

Through data providers, Claude has real-time access to comprehensive financial information:

## Why mba students should learn about agents

Fortune, 9-14-2025:

::: {style="font-size: 0.9em;"}

::: {.quote-box}
PromptQL, an enterprise AI platform created by San Francisco-based developer tooling company Hasura, is doling out <span class="highlight">$900-per-hour</span> wages to its engineers tasked with building and deploying AI agents to analyze internal company data using large language models (LLMs).
:::
::: {.quote-box}
Tanmai Gopal, PromptQL's cofounder and CEO, said "<span class="highlight">MBA types</span> ... are very strategic thinkers, and they're smart people, but they <span class="highlight">don't have an intuition for what AI can do</span>."
:::

![](images/agent_v1.png){style="max-height: 500px; width: auto;"}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {style="font-size: 1.0em;"}
May require chatting at this stage to clarify user's request

![](images/agent_v3.png){style="max-height: 500px; width: auto;"}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {style="font-size: 1.0em;"}
- Response could be error message 
- If so, agent should send to LLM for new SQL code

- Could be more things connected
- E.g., send data to python engine
- Send python output to user

## What can we do in the classroom?

- We can show students how to vibe code apps to automate things 
  - Getting data
  - Financial analysis
  - Getting written analysis from AI 
  - Producing Excel, Word, PowerPoint
- And convert app to chatbot tool

## Tools

- Point and click: ChatGPT's Custom GPTs
- Simplest vibe coding environment: Replit
- Julius.ai can build but not run Streamlit apps
- Google Colab can build  Streamlit apps and deploy via ngrok
- Permanent deployment: Koyeb, Render, ...

::: {.quote-box}
How do we learn this stuff to teach it: Ask AI
:::
:::


## Creating openai custom gpt (No Code)

- **Configure**: Name, description, and system prompt
- **Add capabilities**: Web browsing, DALL-E, Code Interpreter
- **Upload knowledge**: Documents for RAG (PDFs, text files)
- **Add actions**: Connect to external APIs (optional)
- **Test & publish**: Private, link-only, or public to GPT Store

## Plan 

✓ Example of what AI can do today 

✓ Historical analogues

✓ A course on AI

::: {.quote-box}
4. Updating existing courses to use AI

5. Deep dive into Claude Code
:::


## 4. Updating existing courses: what we should teach 

- We generally teach concepts first with slides (or board)
- Then show in tools (usually Excel)
- Now, there is a next step: chatbots and agents

::: {.fragment}
::: {.quote-box}
Teach about implementation in Excel $\rightarrow$ students build Excel models.

Teach about implementation in AI $\rightarrow$ students build prompts or apps
:::
:::

## How we should teach

- AI is a very effective tutor
- We should take advantage of it
- <span class="highlight">Asking students to chat with chatbots can replace "Do the assigned reading."</span>
- Can be assigned before class or in class before slides.

::: {.fragment}
::: {.quote-box}  
Ask your chatbot to teach you about ... Be sure to tell it to ask you questions to ensure you are understanding.
:::
:::

## Controlling the sources 

- Build RAG (Google's Notebook LM or Custom GPT or ...)
- If sources are copyrighted, first ask AI for a complete report on the subject, read and edit the AI report, and add to system prompt "Teach from this report ..."

::: {.fragment}
But this is probably unnecessary for most topics.  The LLMs are much, much more reliable than they were a couple of years ago when everyone was concerned about hallucinations.
:::

## How can we assess?

::: {.incremental}
- Out-of-class assignments should become "turn in your chat, its output, and your evaluation of the output" or "turn in your app."
- In-class <span class="highlight">exams without AI</span> to ensure students understand concepts
- In-class <span class="highlight">exams with AI</span> that are more ambitious than exams today.  Cases can become exams with AI assistance.

## Claude Code

- Terminal based coding agent - also OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI 
- Can be used as a plug-in to VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf 
- Uses standard Anthropic models, but seems to have a great system prompt

::: {style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 30px;"}
*Requires Claude Pro subscription.*
:::

## Capabilities

- Create, edit, copy, move, delete files
- Write, edit, and run Python scripts and notebooks
- Write, edit, and compile LaTeX documents
- Create and edit Word docs and PowerPoint decks
- Create GitHub repos and push and launch apps on hosts (Koyeb, Render, ...)


## Claude Code Demo 


- Create a streamlit app for mean-variance optimization. The user will input the number of assets, their means, standard deviations, and correlations and  risk-free rate.
- Compute and display the tangency portfolio. Run the app.

::: {.fragment}
::: {.quote-box}
Then: show the code that calculates the tangency portfolio and explain it.
:::
:::

## Claude Code in VS Code, etc.

- VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf  are full-featured Python and LaTeX IDEs
- Examples of Claude Code for LaTeX and Python:
  - Read this paragraph and suggest improvements .
  - Make these global edits ...
  - Do this analysis and generate a figure or LaTeX table and insert it into the document ... 

## Aaron Linsky, CTO, AIA Labs at Bridgewater:

::: {style="font-size: 0.9em;"}
::: {.quote-box}
We've been developing capabilities powered by Claude since 2023 within AIA Labs.
:::
::: {.quote-box}
Claude powered the first versions of our <span class="highlight">Investment Analyst Assistant</span>, which streamlined our analysts' workflow by generating Python code, creating data visualizations, and iterating through <span class="highlight"> complex financial analysis tasks with the precision of a junior analyst</span>.
:::
:::


## Yeyati, Brookings, 2025:

::: {style="font-size: 0.9em;"}
::: {.quote-box}
As AI models begin to handle underwriting, compliance, and asset allocation, the traditional architecture of financial work is undergoing a fundamental shift.
:::
::: {.quote-box}
As job descriptions evolve, so does the definition of financial talent. <span class="highlight">Excel is no longer a differentiator. Python is fast becoming the new Excel. </span>
:::
::: {.quote-box}
But technical skills alone will not cut it. The <span class="highlight">most in demand profiles today are those that speak both AI and finance</span>.
